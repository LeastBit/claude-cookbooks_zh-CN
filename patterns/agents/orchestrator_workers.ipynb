      "**Designed for Real Convenience**\n",
      "The wide mouth opening fits ice cubes easily and makes cleaning simple (no hard-to-reach corners). It fits standard cup holders in your car, and the ergonomic design is comfortable to carry whether you're commuting, hiking, or running errands.\n",

      "**Better for Your Wallet and the Planet**\n",
      "By switching to a reusable bottle, you'll save hundreds of dollars annually on disposable bottles while eliminating plastic waste. The durable construction means you're buying one bottle that lasts for years, not replacing cheap alternatives every few months. Plus, you'll avoid the chemicals found in many plastic bottles, ensuring cleaner-tasting water every time.\n",
